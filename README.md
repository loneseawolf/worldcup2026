## 🍴 Personal fork

This is a personal fork of the excellent **[26worldcup/26worldcup.github.io](https://github.com/26worldcup/26worldcup.github.io)** by [Tom Chen](https://github.com/tomchen), used under its MIT license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) / [COPYRIGHT](COPYRIGHT.md)). All credit for the original app — schedule, groups, bracket, squads, venues, weather, probabilities, the Monte-Carlo forecast, and 23 languages — goes to the upstream project.

How this fork differs from upstream:

- 🏆 **Rebranded** to "FIFA World Cup 2026" with a gold FIFA-trophy logo and matching link preview — favicon, regenerated PWA icons, a 1200×630 social/OG image, and an updated web-app manifest.
- 🌙🇵🇭 **Dark theme and Philippine Time (Asia/Manila) by default** (both still changeable in Settings).
- 🧭 **Road to Finals** (`/road`) — pick a champion and see their projected knockout path (most-likely opponent, per-round win probability, Elo difficulty, and cumulative title odds), override any matchup, and share the bracket via a link. Reuses the upstream Elo/simulation engine.
- 📺 **Live page** (`/live`) — a consolidated live-match feed (minute-by-minute events, win probability, team stats, derived player ratings) alongside group standings and where-to-watch.
- 🗳️ **Pick'ems & onboarding** — pick your top teams on first run (they carry into "My Teams" favorites) and fill out a Pick'ems bracket with team-colored slots and FIFA-seed badges.
- 🎨 **UI re-skin** — a champion-driven accent theme, glass navigation, a home "predictions zone" with floating title odds, a collapsible schedule, and a FAQ page.
- ⚙️ **Hardened live-update CI** — a self-bridging relay keeps the data pipeline warm across overnight match gaps so live updates survive dropped scheduled runs.

## ✨ Features

### 🏆 Tournament

- 📅 **All 104 matches** with kick-off times, stadiums, group/stage chips, and semi-live scores
- 🔍 **Schedule** filterable by team(s), stage, and venue; filters live in the URL, so views are shareable
- 📊 **Group tables** computed with the official FIFA tiebreakers, plus the ranking of third-placed teams (top 8 of 12 advance) with qualification colour-coding
- 🪜 **Knockout bracket** as a centre-converging tree that fills in automatically as teams qualify, with no horizontal scrolling; reflows to a round-by-round list on phones
- 📋 **Match pages**: venue facts, win/draw/loss **probabilities**, kick-off weather forecast (typical-climate fallback for far-off dates), full referee crew, starting line-ups drawn on an SVG pitch with formations, goal timeline, and TV channels for your country

### 👕 Teams & players

- 🧢 **48 team pages**: live FIFA ranking, coach, group table, full fixtures, training base camp (with map + Google Maps links), official website, and Wikipedia links
- 👥 **Official 26-player squads**: numbers, positions, ages, caps, goals, clubs; every player links to their English Wikipedia article
- ⭐ **Favorites**: star the teams you follow and filter the schedule to them

### 🗺️ Venues & maps

- 🌎 **Real-geography map** of all 16 stadiums (Natural Earth data, Lambert conformal conic projection) with capacity, roof type, time zone, and June/July climate for every venue
- 🏕️ **Team base camps** plotted on the same map as flag pins (collision-free layout), with a team filter that highlights only the cities where a selected team plays

### 📺 Watching

- 📡 **Broadcast guide for 32 countries/regions** with free-to-air channels highlighted; your country is auto-detected from the device time zone (changeable in Settings)

### 📊 Stats & predictions

- 👟 **Golden-boot table** and tournament stats, updated throughout the competition
- 🎲 **Match probabilities & tournament forecast**: every fixture gets a win/draw/loss **probability** from an Elo model replayed over 49,000 historical internationals blended with the official FIFA ranking, and the **forecast** page lets you **simulate** the whole tournament (group tables, knockout bracket, extra time, penalty shoot-outs) 1 to 10,000 times, starting from now, the opening match, a date, or any match number, then shows not just each team's title odds but a full **outcome table**: how every team finishes its group, the round it bows out in, and its final placing, all the way to the trophy, like a fun **prediction** machine

### 🌍 Languages

- **23 languages**, covering the languages of all participating teams plus some popular ones: English · Français · Español · Português (Portugal) · Português (Brasil) · Deutsch · Nederlands · Čeština · Hrvatski · Svenska · Norsk · العربية · فارسی · Türkçe · Oʻzbekcha · 日本語 · 한국어 · 简体中文 · 繁體中文 · Italiano · Bahasa Indonesia · Русский · Українська
- Automatic detection and full RTL support for Arabic and Persian
- Team, stadium, and referee names are additionally served in FIFA's own localisation for 12 of these languages; the rest fall back to English names while the interface stays translated. The language can be switched any time from the header; dictionaries load on demand

### 🎁 Experience

- 🕒 **Time zones**: match times default to *your* clock; switch to stadium-local time or any fixed zone (the host-anchor default is America/New_York)
- 📲 **PWA**: installable on desktop and mobile, works fully offline after the first visit (everything except live score refreshes)
- 📆 **Calendar export**: download an `.ics` file of your teams' matches
- 🌗 **Light & dark themes**, automatic by default
- 🔒 **Self-contained**: flags, fonts, map data, and all tournament data are served locally; the app makes **zero third-party requests** at runtime

## 📱 Compatibility

- **Screens**: responsive from small phones (360 px) to large desktops; bottom tab bar on mobile, full navigation on desktop
- **Browsers**: current Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari (desktop and iOS)
- **Install**: as a PWA from the browser menu on Android, iOS ("Add to Home Screen"), and desktop Chrome/Edge
- **Accessibility**: keyboard-navigable controls, visible focus states, WCAG AA contrast in both themes, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

## ⚡ Data: fresh after every match

All data comes from free, authoritative sources, with no API keys anywhere:

| Source | Provides |
|---|---|
| FIFA public API | fixtures, scores, line-ups, referees, localized names, world ranking |
| Wikipedia | official 26-player squads (numbers, caps, goals, clubs, coaches) |
| Open-Meteo | hourly stadium weather forecasts and base-camp geocoding |
| martj42/international_results (CC0) | historical results feeding the Elo win-probability model |
| Hand-curated files | venues, broadcasters, base camps, climate normals, team colours |

**Automatic updates** (GitHub Actions, included in this repo):

- ⏱️ **every 15 minutes while matches are being played** (plus a line-ups pull 10 minutes before each kick-off)
- 🌙 **daily at 00:00 New York time**
- ✅ every update is sanity-checked before publishing and triggers a site redeploy

Scores are **semi-live, not real-time**: they typically trail the broadcast by up to ~15 minutes. This is by design; the whole app is static JSON refreshed by CI, with no servers, sockets or push infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Development

For developers of this project.

### 🚀 Quick start

```bash
bun install
bun run update   # fetch the latest data
bun run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

(`npm` works too — `npm install` / `npm run dev` — if you don't have `bun`; CI uses `bun`.)

Production build (fully static output in `dist/`):

```bash
bun run build
bun run preview
```

### 📜 Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bun run dev` | Vite dev server at `localhost:5173` |
| `bun run build` | type-check and production build into `dist/` |
| `bun run preview` | serve the built `dist/` locally |
| `bun run update` | refresh all tournament data (FIFA, Wikipedia, Open-Meteo) into `public/data/` |
| `bun run gencron` | regenerate the CI cron schedule from the match calendar |
| `bun run genmap` | rebuild the venues map from Natural Earth source data |
| `bun run typecheck` | TypeScript type check (`tsc -b`, no emit) |
| `bun run format` | Biome auto-format (writes) |
| `bun run lint` | Biome lint + format check (includes a11y rules) |
| `bun run smoke` | headless smoke test: every route across languages and themes |
| `bun run a11y` | axe-core WCAG A/AA audit: routes × light/dark × RTL |
| `bun run checkall` | quick gate: typecheck + format + lint |
| `bun run checkall:build` | full gate: checkall + build + smoke + a11y |

<details>
<summary><b>🌐 Adding a language</b></summary>

1. Create `src/i18n/<code>.ts` with every key from `en.ts`, same order (plus `key#one`-style plural variants where the grammar needs them).
2. Wire it: `Lang` union in `types.ts`; `LOCALE_TAG` + `LANG_LABEL` in `i18n/strings.ts` (key order = menu order); loader in `i18n/index.tsx`; detection prefix in `SettingsContext.tsx`; `RTL_LANGS` / `DATA_FALLBACK` if applicable.
3. If `api.fifa.com` serves the language, add it to `LANGS` in `scripts/update.mjs`; otherwise add it to `CLDR_LANGS` there (team names then come from CLDR country names) and add England/Scotland to `team-names-l10n.json` — they are GB subdivisions CLDR cannot name.
4. Translate the curated bits: 16 `rainNote` entries (`climate.json`), 90 broadcaster notes (`broadcasters.json`), the SF Bay Area label (`Venues.tsx`), 16 city names (`city-l10n.json`, non-Latin scripts only), and a full 48-name block in `team-names-l10n.json` only if local naming conventions differ from CLDR (as Traditional Chinese does).
5. Add a smoke pass, update this README's language list, run `bun run update && bun run build && bun run smoke`.

</details>

### 🚢 Deploying

The app is a static site with hash routing and relative asset paths. For GitHub Pages:

1. Push to the repository.
2. `deploy.yml` builds and publishes on every push to `main` (documentation-only and pipeline-only changes are skipped).
3. `update-data.yml` refreshes the data on the match-driven schedule above and redeploys. Its cron table is generated from the fixed match calendar; run `bun run gencron` if a kick-off time ever changes.

### 🐳 Docker (self-hosting)

A small image (nginx serving the built PWA) published to **`ghcr.io/26worldcup/26worldcup`**. Where it reads match data is set by the `DATA_SOURCE` env var; the app is served at **http://localhost:8080** either way.

| `DATA_SOURCE` | `/data/*.json` from | Freshness | Network |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `remote` *(default)* | reverse-proxied from the live site | always current, incl. live scores | outbound to `REMOTE_DATA_HOST` |
| `self` | an updater sidecar that runs the data pipeline | near-live (own `UPDATE_INTERVAL`) | outbound to FIFA/Wikipedia/Open-Meteo |

#### 1. `remote` mode (default): always-fresh data proxied from the live site

**1.1 Use the prebuilt image** (no clone):

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/26worldcup/26worldcup:latest
```

**1.2 Build your own** (local changes, or before an image is published):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/26worldcup/26worldcup.github.io.git
cd 26worldcup.github.io
docker build -t ghcr.io/26worldcup/26worldcup:latest .          # build the local image
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/26worldcup/26worldcup:latest   # same tag → runs your build, no pull
```

#### 2. `self` mode: self-updating, no dependency on the live site

Two containers share a volume: the web server (`DATA_SOURCE=self`) and an updater that re-runs the data pipeline every `UPDATE_INTERVAL` seconds (default `900` = 15 min). The volume is seeded from the image's baked snapshot, so the site works immediately and is replaced by fresh data after the first run.

**2.1 Use the prebuilt images** (no clone), run the pair directly:

```bash
docker volume create wc-data
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -e DATA_SOURCE=self --restart unless-stopped \
  -v wc-data:/usr/share/nginx/html/data \
  ghcr.io/26worldcup/26worldcup:latest
docker run -d -e UPDATE_INTERVAL=900 --restart unless-stopped \
  -v wc-data:/app/public/data \
  ghcr.io/26worldcup/26worldcup-updater:latest
```

**2.2 Build your own** (Compose builds both the web and updater images):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/26worldcup/26worldcup.github.io.git
cd 26worldcup.github.io
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.self.yml up -d --build
```
